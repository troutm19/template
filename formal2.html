			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>A commercial on TV, an ad in the newspaper, an employee waving around a sign to inform people about a new sale, what do these all have in common with each other? They are all forms of marketing.  Marketing is all around us; it is a crucial part of the business process and also important in our daily lives. Without marketing businesses would be unable to get information about their new ideas out to the consumers, leaving people without knowledge of new goods and services being offered. There are many aspects involved in the marketing process. Research is one of the main components. In order to effectively market a product, you need to establish exactly what kind of person you are selling to. This task goes to market researchers. They start with collecting demographic information from consumers and then work to pinpoint whom the target market is for the product. Once this target market is determined, marketers need to figure out how they want to advertise the idea to the customer.  Advertising is another important element of successful marketing. Without the advertising branch of marketing, marketers would be unable to sell their product to the desired target market. Marketers in charge of advertising need to find the best way to communicate their idea to the potential customers.  Both advertising and market research are crucial factors in marketing and neither could be done without technology. In this day and age technology has helped the discipline of marketing flourish.  The research, advertising and technology components of marketing, combine to create a successful sale of a product. </p>
