			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>An ad for a new item appears in the middle of a commercial break on TV.   Someone sees the ad, loves the product, and goes to the store to buy it. This seems like simple cause and effect, but a lot of “behind-the-scenes” work has gone into this simple scenario. People employed in a field called marketing handle this “behind-the-scenes” work. Without marketing it would be harder for people to hear about new goods or services. Marketing has two main components that are a necessity when it comes to the successful marketing of a product. The first component is the research part of marketing. Market researchers collect and interpret data from the consumers in a market. They then determine the target market of a product and how to best sell that product to the customers. This is where the second component of marketing makes its’ appearance. Advertising is the other main component in successful marketing and without it, getting information about a new product out to consumers would be impossible. Marketers involved in advertising communicate their ideas to the target market of a product. With ads on billboards, radio, TV, and tons of other mediums, advertisers effectively sell their product to consumers. And now with social media, smart phones and other technology, communicating with the customer is even easier to do. Market research and advertising are just two of the main components involved in the marketing discipline that are essential when striving for the effective selling of a product.</p>
