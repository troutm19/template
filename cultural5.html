			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>Personally I believe that technology has taken over a large part of our lives and too often distracts us from what’s important. Our constant craving for technology to complete every task we need done isn’t right. Kids nowadays spend a large majority of their time playing video games and staying inside messing with electronics instead of going outside or playing with friends and family. Advances in technology have made our lives a lot easier, but to what costs? Technology isn’t a bad thing…in moderation. However, humans have a tendency to be lazy and most electronics give them more of a reason to be so. As time goes on and this dependency on technology is getting worse, society needs to start finding ways to put an end to our constant reliance. Now that we have these breakthroughs in technology, our next step should be figuring out how to keep our tech filled lives within reason.  In order to keep people from staring at electronics all the time, more programs should be put in place that promote being active and going tech free for even small parts of people’s day. Some programs that exist now are even through, believe it or not, TV stations. Disney Channel’s-Magic of Healthy Living has fun games to try outside, healthy recipes to cook and advertise other Disney programs like Friends For Change-a program that encourages kids to volunteer in their communities. Activities like these encourage people to get out and try new things that don’t involve technology. Another TV station that promotes going technology free is Nickelodeon. Once a year the channel launches it’s electronic free campaign- World Wide Day Of Play. Once a year for a whole day the channel suspends broadcasting of all TV shows on their network, urging individuals to turn of the television and go out and be active. Although many of the programs that exist now are through specific TV channels, hopefully in the future hundreds of different companies or even individuals work to create programs that urge people to turn off the electronics. Programs like this can help keep the usage of technology in check and can hopefully have lasting effects on those who partake in the programs. </p>
