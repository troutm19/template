			<h1>Research Section</h1>
<p>Research is a crucial component necessary in the marketing process. Without research a target market would not be established and there would be no information on the market size or competition within the market.  In the article “Marketing: Seven Steps to a Successful Marketing Plan” the author states, “Any marketing plans begins as an approximation; it must then be tailored to meet a firm's specific needs”. Market research helps take the broad original marketing plan and turns it into a detailed strategy that caters perfectly to what the company’s plan for the product should be. There are many different ways in which market research can be conducted. The data that is being collected can either be primary information or secondary information. Primary information is when the data compiled was either done by an individual or a person hired to gather info by a company or person. Secondary information is research and data collection that has already been done for you. Examples of this are reports done by the government or other businesses within the same industry. A company can obtain primary information from methods like surveys. Surveys can be handed out, done over the phone or come in the form of a questionnaire on a website. There are many other ways of collecting data via surveys however, and it is important to note that Primary information is not only limited to surveys, it just happens to be a very common form of data collection. Qualitative vs. quantitative data is also an important aspect that needs to be decided before research can be conducted. Qualitative data cannot be measured, in other words qualitative data is information that can be observed and interpreted while quantitative data is based strictly on numerical measurements. Another important question to answer along with how and what type of data will be collected is whom is the information being obtained for? Research can be done either for a business-to-business market or a business-to-consumer market. Business-to-business market research is more complicated than business-to-consumer market research. When collecting information from the public in a business-to-consumer market, there are many elements in defining a target market. Market researchers look at age, gender, income, location, and level of education as well as many other aspects of a consumer’s life. Market researchers are able to take this all of this data from customers in the market to help them identify exactly whom they are marketing their product to. After establishing a target market, researchers are able to do a test run for their product on individuals who fall into their chosen customers. Market researchers refer to this part of the research process as the test market. The test market consists of consumers who are randomly selected from a database that contains people who are considered to be part of the ideal target market. The random selection gives each person an equal chance of being chosen for the test market. After being selected the group is taken through the entire marketing process, just on a smaller scale. Instead of launching a product right away, market researchers establish a test market in order to study the effectiveness of the current marketing of the product as well as observe consumer’s first thoughts on the item. Market research is important, but effective marketing would be impossible without the help of the other components of marketing. <img src="qualvsquan" alt="Quantitative Vs.
