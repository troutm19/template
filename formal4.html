			<h1>Communication Section</h1>
			<p>After researching whom the product is being marketed to, marketers next step is to figure out how to best advertise the product to the consumers or businesses that they are selling to. Advertising is all about finding the best way to communicate to the customers. There are hundreds of different ways in which a good or service can be advertised. Television and radio ads, as well as ads in magazines may come to mind first; however, advertising through those mediums can be expensive and because of this, not all companies resort to those forms of ads first. Smaller companies, or even larger companies not yet ready to spend their cash on expensive advertising look to cheaper, but not necessarily less effective, types of advertising. Word of mouth is an obvious example of cheap advertising. This form of marketing is completely free and although it may seem less efficient, word of mouth may be more useful than one might think. Word of mouth occurs constantly throughout our daily life. A stranger on the bus talking to you about a product they just tried, your sister calling you about some great fast food place that just opened up by her, there are tons of different examples of advertising through word of mouth that we see in any given day. A downside to this form of marketing though, is that the communication that takes place between individuals does not always have to be positive advertising. If a customer has tried a new product on the market and hated it, someone will most likely hear about it from them. The other very common type of cheap advertising is through social media. Brian Demoe, a former professor who taught business at Oakland University stated, “Everything with marketing is social nowadays”. Today, most individuals own a smart phone or computer therefore giving them easy access to social media websites. Sites like Facebook and Twitter are full of companies trying to promote their product. With technology and social media being so commonplace, online advertising is getting more and more popular. There are tons of ways that marketers take advantage of the consumer’s addiction to the Internet and social media. There can be links for ads on the sidebars of websites, as well as celebrities on apps like Twitter endorsing a company’s product. Social media is very popular and because younger kids as well as older adults are starting to use social media websites, companies are able to reach an even larger audience. It is important to note that just because a type of advertisement is more expensive, it is not always more effective. No matter what the type of advertisement though, it is essential to decide what the best type of ad for a product is, as well as whom the ad is being directed to.  Determining the best way to reach the target market through advertising is crucial to effective communication with the customer. If a commercial for a child’s toy is being advertised on the History Channel, for example, then the company responsible for the ad has failed to establish communication with the target market. So finding the best way to advertise to the target market is extremely important and essential in establishing rapport with the desired group  of consumers. Advertising in marketing does not always involve technology however, more and more people are using technology in order to market their ideas.</p>
