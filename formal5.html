			<h1>Technology Section</h1>
<p>Technology is prevalent in both the research and advertising aspect of marketing. Although this may not have been the case a decade ago, the outbreak of technology over the years has lead to easier data collection for market researchers as well as more effective advertising. Market researchers have really utilized today’s new technology to better their data collection techniques. This helps them get more information from consumers in the market. There are now hundreds of ways for market researchers to get information from individuals without even having to directly contact them. Technologies such as cookies, that are small pieces of information stored in a web browser, are commonly used in market research. Marketers are able to collect information from you such as your tastes and preferences and create a “profile” for you based on websites you have visited. Market researchers are able to see what kinds of goods and services interest you so that they can later advertise similar products to you. After the research is done the information goes over to the advertising side of marketing in order to get the new products out on the market. Nowadays technology and advertising almost seem synonymous, most of the time they go together hand-in-hand. Companies use television ads, radio ads, social media and lots of other mediums to get their new products noticed. With technology being so wide spread many people own smartphones and it is now easier to advertise products to them. Most people keep their phone on them all day, this means companies are able to advertise products to individuals any time they use their phone to surf the web or access a social media website. In the article “Elephant in the Room” a study done in September by comScore stated, “For smartphone owners, 4 out of 5 use their devices to access retail content”. This means that not only is it easier for companies to advertise their ideas to customers, but also companies are able to lure consumers in with advertising, then allow them to purchase the product almost instantly. Technology is essential in this day and age to successful marketing and without it, market research; the other component of marketing would not be as easily obtainable.</p>		</article>
