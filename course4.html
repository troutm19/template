<h1>Formal Research Project</h1>
<p>The third assignment in the class in my opinion was the hardest. The formal research paper as made obvious by the name is a very formal paper; you are expected to write an objective and informative essay. You are asked to write an in-depth research paper on a discipline of your choice and how research, technology and communication operate in that discipline.  This paper is the most formal of all the assignments expected of you in the class. The difficulty lies in the length of the paper and the amount of research necessary to do well on the assignment. This is the longest paper you will write in the class, however hopefully since you are writing about a discipline that interests you it won’t necessarily be as hard to write a large amount verses writing about a topic that you don’t care about. Another aspect of the paper that is difficult is you have to do a lot of research to get background information on your discipline. There are a lot of resources given to you though that can help in the research process and make it easy for you to obtain the information you need. Along with research you need to interview professionals in the field that you are writing the paper on. Specifically you need to interview a professor who teaches the discipline as well as someone who works in the field of the discipline you are writing about. Although the paper is one of the more difficult assignments you are given it is a great opportunity to learn about the discipline you are interested in. The project allows students to gain a lot of information and give more insight into how the field they have chosen really operates. </p>
