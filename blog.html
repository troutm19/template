			<h2>Narrative</h2>
			<p>The purpose of the video was a chance for Randy Potts to share the story of his gay uncle Ronnie's suicide 
			with others. It also was an opportunity for Randy to be honest with himself and his uncle on how he really
			felt about his uncle Ronnie taking his life. The message of the video was if you're gay, you're not alone, there
			are others out there just like you with the same struggles and ways you can get help if you need support. The
			video achieved everything it set out to. The message accurately showed how suicide doesn't just harm you but
			others, and described if you are having a hard time accepting who you are there are people you can go to for help.
			The message is structure is very loose and personal. The message is deep and although the letter is addressed to 
			Randy's uncle Ronnie,the whole story really applies and is relevant to all other people who may be struggling with
			homosexuality. The structure of this video has helped me revise my Lived Experiences Project by showing me that 
			narratives don't really have limits. There is no right way to write a narrative, for example there is no set in
			stone structure of 5 paragraphs, it is a personal account and story that you get to tell in your own unique way.</p>
			<h2>South Park Analysis</h2>
			<p>The group that is targeted in the South Park episode is people who over excessively play online games, specifically World Of War Craft.  The episode pokes fun at people who make video games their life. They constantly play and see the World of War Craft as important as the real world. I found the show’s creator’s view really funny on the topic. Although they are just stereotyping I think it is funny that they made an episode devoted to exposing some of the realities of online gamers. Some people really do get so involved in the online games that they lose sight of reality and what is actually important.</p>
			<h2>Chrysler Commercial:Imported From Detroit</h2>
			<p>The Chrysler ad effectively conveys the point it set out to make. The purpose of the commercial is to make Chrysler, specifically the Chrysler 200, appear to be a super luxurious and desirable product. The purpose is achieved mainly through three components of the ad. The first is the imagery of Detroit in the background of the commercial.  Detroit was once known as being a very majestic city. Although now the city’s image isn’t as great as it once was, there is still much history and grace left in certain parts of the city. These landmarks that display the once renowned city’s class are shown in the commercial, for example the Fox theatre is shown. Another similar aspect of the ad that backs up the main purpose is the inclusion of Eminem in the ad. Eminem is known as being a self-made man. He came from the bottom of society and has risen to the top. This is symbolism for Detroit itself. The ad is trying to convey that although it may seem that Detroit has fallen, it can rise up again, and still retains its’ stately reputation from long ago. The last element that helps back up the ad’s purpose is the voice over that occurs throughout the commercial. The man speaking with a calm and very dominating voice sounds like someone who is stern and knows what they are talking about. He tells the viewers that the Detroit they “know” is not what it seems; that the stories they have read about Detroit are written by people who don’t live there or even know the real story of what is occurring there. He states those people have no idea what Detroit is capable of. The narrator in the background backs up the city by assuring individuals that Detroit is strong as ever, and still knows luxury.</p>
			<h2>Lived Experiences Project</h2>
			<p>The lived experiences project was an informal paper that was in the form of a narrative and required you to explain how a specific piece of technology helped you in deciding your major. For me I chose television as the electronic that effected my decision in choosing what I would study at Michigan State. The paper was a struggle for me, because I had never written a narrative before. In high school all of the papers we wrote were very formal for example we usually wrote things like a literary analysis for novels. This paper really helped my writing skills improve and opened me up to a completely different type of writing style. This assignment can be difficult if you do not have a major decided upon yet or if you are considering changing your major. Obviously it is easier to write about something that you are interested in so if you have a career plan for yourself already in mind I think that made things a lot easier for me when I was writing. My major was marketing so I got very lucky, because technology is such a huge part of marketing today. With social media, television and other mediums that are used for advertising today picking a piece of technology that influenced my decision in choosing my major was relatively easy. Overall, I liked this assignment and as our first paper I think it was a good level of difficulty to ease us into the writing process.</p>
			<h2>Cultural Analysis</h2>
			<p>The cultural analysis paper was one of my favorite activities that we did during the semester. It was more formal than the lived experiences project, which was good for me, because I think I write formal papers better than informal papers. The cultural analysis project lets you pick a social issue of your choice and then back up the issue with an artifact. This artifact can be a video game, TV show, movie etc. the purpose of it is just that you can take a modern day object and have it support your main point of your social issue. For me I picked American’s and even humans as a whole dependency on technology in the current day and age. Technology is everywhere, it is a huge part of our lives and most of us would probably struggle if we had to go a day without it. This is the point I set out to prove in my cultural analysis paper. I used the movie Wall-E to back up my main point. This movie accurately depicts the potential dangers we may face if society continues to depend on technology as much as it does.  The paper really helped my writing skill grow. It was kind of an argumentative essay in the fact that you set out to prove a point and use statistics and information to convince your audience that the social issue you are writing about is an actual problem that needs to be solved. </p>
			<h2>Remix Project</h2>
			<p>The Remix project was my favorite project overall. After writing papers it was nice to get a break and get to work on a video where you can be more creative when creating your documentary. In my group my cultural analysis paper was chosen for the project, this made things a lot easier, because I already had a lot of background information on the topic and also the video was more fun to make because I had personal interest on the subject. Working with a group was difficult at time, because a lot of times you have to come to a consensus on something and it may not be what you had wanted. It’s hard to compromise, but overall I think this project is better when working in a group, because for me at least I didn’t have any experience with moviemaker/iMovie and working with other people helped me. Along with not having used iMovie I had also never done anything like this project before. I had never made a video in the form of a documentary. A documentary I think is even more difficult than other forms of video, because you need to make decisions for the film that are going to be good for the audience. The audience and how they will perceive your video is one of the most important elements of this project. I learned that even the little things like how the video is set up and the layout of the slides is crucial to the documentary. </p>
			<h2>Commercial Analysis</h2>
			<p>As a marketing major I am really interested in commercials and judging whether an advertisement is effective or not. Much like when we reviewed the “Imported from Detroit” I collected a couple of my favorite commercials that I remember and decided to analyze the commercials and discuss their strategies and if they were effective.</p>
			<h3>Google New Years Commercial</h3>
			<p>The overall goal of Google’s “Google Zeitgeist” commercial is obviously to promote the search engine-Google. The company in my opinion definitely accomplishes its’ purpose. The entire video contains clips of important events that have occurred throughout the year of 2013. Not only does it show these events though, the commercial starts out saying “in 2013, the world searched for…” and then after showing someone typing the different things that were searched using Google collectively over the year very impactful and emotional events are displayed. The commercial was brilliantly done I think, because it was really emotionally appealing. This tactic is called “pathos” in advertising. The commercial targeted many different emotions and the really smart thing that I think Google’s advertising team did was that there was something for everyone in the video. There is such a wide range of different clips in the commercial and I think it was a very successful campaign. By using people of impact like the Pope, Obama and Nelson Mandela it really grabs the audiences and lets them know that what is happening on the screen is important and demands their attention.</p>
