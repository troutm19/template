			<h1>blog</h1>
			<p>The purpose of the video was a chance for Randy Potts to share the story of his gay uncle Ronnie's suicide 
			with others. It also was an opportunity for Randy to be honest with himself and his uncle on how he really
			felt about his uncle Ronnie taking his life. The message of the video was if you're gay, you're not alone, there
			are others out there just like you with the same struggles and ways you can get help if you need support. The
			video achieved everything it set out to. The message accurately showed how suicide doesn't just harm you but
			others, and described if you are having a hard time accepting who you are there are people you can go to for help.
			The message is structure is very loose and personal. The message is deep and although the letter is addressed to 
			Randy's uncle Ronnie,the whole story really applies and is relevant to all other people who may be struggling with
			homosexuality. The structure of this video has helped me revise my Lived Experiences Project by showing me that 
			narratives don't really have limits. There is no right way to write a narrative, for example there is no set in
			stone structure of 5 paragraphs, it is a personal account and story that you get to tell in your own unique way.</p>
			<h1>South Park Analysis</h1>
			<p>The group that is targeted in the South Park episode is people who over excessively play online games, specifically World Of War Craft.  The episode pokes fun at people who make video games their life. They constantly play and see the World of War Craft as important as the real world. I found the show’s creator’s view really funny on the topic. Although they are just stereotyping I think it is funny that they made an episode devoted to exposing some of the realities of online gamers. Some people really do get so involved in the online games that they lose sight of reality and what is actually important.</p>
			<h1>Chrysler Commercial:Imported From Detroit</h1>
			<p>The Chrysler ad effectively conveys the point it set out to make. The purpose of the commercial is to make Chrysler, specifically the Chrysler 200, appear to be a super luxurious and desirable product. The purpose is achieved mainly through three components of the ad. The first is the imagery of Detroit in the background of the commercial.  Detroit was once known as being a very majestic city. Although now the city’s image isn’t as great as it once was, there is still much history and grace left in certain parts of the city. These landmarks that display the once renowned city’s class are shown in the commercial, for example the Fox theatre is shown. Another similar aspect of the ad that backs up the main purpose is the inclusion of Eminem in the ad. Eminem is known as being a self-made man. He came from the bottom of society and has risen to the top. This is symbolism for Detroit itself. The ad is trying to convey that although it may seem that Detroit has fallen, it can rise up again, and still retains its’ stately reputation from long ago. The last element that helps back up the ad’s purpose is the voice over that occurs throughout the commercial. The man speaking with a calm and very dominating voice sounds like someone who is stern and knows what they are talking about. He tells the viewers that the Detroit they “know” is not what it seems; that the stories they have read about Detroit are written by people who don’t live there or even know the real story of what is occurring there. He states those people have no idea what Detroit is capable of. The narrator in the background backs up the city by assuring individuals that Detroit is strong as ever, and still knows luxury.</p>
