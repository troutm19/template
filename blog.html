			<p>The purpose of the video was a chance for Randy Potts to share the story of his gay uncle Ronnie's suicide 
			with others. It also was an opportunity for Randy to be honest with himself and his uncle on how he really
			felt about his uncle Ronnie taking his life. The message of the video was if you're gay, you're not alone, there
			are others out there just like you with the same struggles and ways you can get help if you need support. The
			video achieved everything it set out to. The message accurately showed how suicide doesn't just harm you but
			others, and described if you are having a hard time accepting who you are there are people you can go to for help.
			The message is structure is very loose and personal. The message is deep and although the letter is addressed to 
			Randy's uncle Ronnie,the whole story really applies and is relevant to all other people who may be struggling with
			homosexuality. The structure of this video has helped me revise my Lived Experiences Project by showing me that 
			narratives don't really have limits. There is no right way to write a narrative, for example there is no set in
			stone structure of 5 paragraphs, it is a personal account and story that you get to tell in your own unique way.</p>
