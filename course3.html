<h1>Cultural Analysis</h1>
<p>The second assignment given to you in Writing 110 is the cultural analysis paper. Personally this was my favorite assignment in the class. The paper requires you to pick a social issue that is prevalent in society today and interests you. Along with choosing a social issue you need to find an artifact of popular culture, for example a TV show, movie or video game that helps represent and support the social issue you have chosen to focus on in your paper. To wrap up the essay you need to come up with a solution that will fix the social issue at hand. The Cultural Analysis assignment is a little more difficult than the first paper, because it involves conducting some research on your social issue. This assignment is also more formal than the first paper, but is still not extremely formal. You still have some freedom in being creative, but the essay takes on less of a narrative form.  This project I found to be easier because you are writing about a social issue of your choice and hopefully the topic you choose to write about is something you are interested in. The overall goal of the paper is to prove to readers that the current social issue that you chose for your paper is a prominent problem in our lives that needs to be addressed. You also need to make sure that the artifact you choose to represent your social issue helps prove and backs up your main point that the social issue at hand needs to be fixed. The cultural analysis paper can be a lot of fun to write and also very interesting once you start getting into it, this assignment also is most likely to help you with a topic for another project later on in the semester.</p>
