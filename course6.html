<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I found that for all of the projects we did in the semester I had a lot of freedom in picking a topic for my papers that really interested me and therefore made the writing process a lot easier. Working on an assignment that I was really personally invested in made papers easier to write and also I got to learn a lot more about topics I was interested in, but didn’t know much about before taking the class.  If you are not someone who typically enjoys or excels at writing, but are required to take a writing class, Writing 110 is a great class to take because you learn a lot and get to improve your writing skills while getting to do a lot of unique assignments that you wouldn’t find in a typical writing class. </p>
