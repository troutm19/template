			<h1>Technology Overload</h1>
			<h2>Remix Memo</h2>
			<p>The social issue that my group decided we would use for our project is society’s dependency on technology. Having a topic focused on technology dependence shaped our project to contain a lot of personal accounts and interviews. Being surrounded by a generation full of students that use technology so much in their daily lives we thought one of the most effective ways to validate our issue was to interview some of our peers and get an inside look at just how much people depend on their electronics. While collecting our information and interviewing students we got to see how some people really do suffer from this “addiction” to technology. Some problems we ran into when composing the documentary is a lot of the editing portion. No one in the group had particular experience in making videos so it was kind of a learning experience for all of us and we had to learn things as we went along. Also it was hard to decide how to present the information to the audience, for example what the overall structure of the documentary would look like. The audience was our main concern, we had to look at things from their perspective a lot of the time and think about how they would interpret all of the information we would be throwing at them. The process of picking the topic was pretty easy for my group. We all agreed that we wanted to do the documentary on the social issue paper we had written and after sharing all of our topics for the paper we came to a consensus. The most challenging part of the project for me was the editing and figuring out what I wanted the structure of the video for me, my group actually had a lot of ideas on that though which helped me brainstorm some ideas as well. I think interviews were the most and least beneficial research methods at times. It really depended on whom you interviewed. Some of the students I interviewed didn’t really give much information and answered my questions in more of a simple yes or no manner while other students were really helpful and expanded a lot on the topic they were talking about. I think my group worked really well together. We met a few times to complete the documentary as well as the proposal and we all contributed equally I think. We were all new to making movies so I think it was beneficial to work in a group in that aspect, however group projects usually require compromise because you do need to take other people’s opinions into account and sometimes that can be hard if you don’t completely agree or like the proposed idea. We didn’t have any big disagreements though so overall I think it benefited us that it was a group project. We planned our work on our project really well actually. I have worked in a group project before where we wait until the last minute, but I got really lucky with my group that they were willing to work on the project early so that we weren’t rushing towards the end. If I could do it over again I think the only thing we could have done better was meet another day for the editing of the video. I think we underestimated how difficult it would be to put everything all together, especially since none of us had done a project like this before. I think the most effective part of our documentary was how we designed the video and how we set it up. We first inform our audience of the issue, and then provide some interviews with people that help demonstrate our topic and then in the end we show statistics that further prove the issue at hand. Our design was developed by all of us. When we were planning it we just thought about how the information would be most convincing when presented to the audience. We made our design the way it is in hopes that we can prove to the audience that society does have a dependency on technology. </p>
