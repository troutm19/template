			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>Overall, successful marketing cannot exist without proper research, effective advertising, and nowadays technology. A crucial aspect of a business, marketing focuses on the consumer rather than the company itself. The main goal of marketing is to get new goods and services out on the market for customers to buy. However, the process of achieving this goal is more complex than it seems. With a marketing plan outlined by the marketing mix, marketers work to strictly define a strategy that is going to make their product sell as much as possible. Using the four p’s as a base, other branches of marketing strive to do their part in order to help their idea become popular. Market researchers do all that they can to obtain data from the individuals in the market in order to determine the product’s target market as well find the best way to get the product out to the established target market. Advertising is the other main aspect of marketing and is responsible for getting ideas out to the people. Advertising is a way for companies to communicate with buyers, and get the people to buy their product. Both advertising and market research are vital to successful marketing and in today’s day and age; neither of these elements can be done without the help of technology. Technology is seen all throughout marketing. With data collection techniques in market research and social media aiding advertising, today’s plethora of new technology is helping the discipline of marketing become easier and more successful. All of these components are key in developing an effective marketing plan as well as developing a product that will sell. </p>
