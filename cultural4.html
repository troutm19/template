			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>Wall-E is a movie about the potential dangers that can affect society if humans continue to have such a strong dependency on technology. The Pixar film starts out in the year 2805. The picture is zoomed out so you can see Earth, a desolate wasteland; the image zooms in more and takes you into a city filled to the brim with garbage. Meanwhile due to the Earth’s deteriorated condition humans have taken residence in Space on large cruise-like space ships. Along with the people on the ship, there also are robots to cater to every need the humans may have. Even basic tasks such as getting dressed are done by these motorized machines. The movie depicts huge breakthroughs in technology in the future. This may sound great however; all the new technology didn’t leave humans unscathed. On these space ships the humans are morbidly obese and sit in hovercraft chairs with television screens in front of them. Not only are they living an unhealthy lifestyle, but also humans don’t even know there is life beyond the television screens that are constantly in their face all day. To communicate with each other, even people right next to them, the TV monitors display an image of the person they are talking to rather than just turning their head and speaking with each other face to face. It isn’t until Wall-E (a robot from Earth) gets onto the space ship and knocks two people out of their chairs that they have contact for the first time that isn’t through a screen. Also the captain of the space ship relies on an autopilot system instead of controlling the craft itself. This dependency on technology continues until the pilot decides he wants to control the ship himself and go back to Earth. However, once the auto-pilot system realized the captain no longer wanted its’ help the technology fights back and does everything it can to prevent the discarding of the auto-pilot system along with all other technology on the ship. In this movie technology overall has not benefitted society, humans are unable to effectively communicate with each other, their health is at risk due to the lack of exercise they get and they have lost all autonomy in their lives. Wall-E may show the extremes of where humanity will end up due to the reliance on technology, but it shows possibilities of what can happen nonetheless. This inability to go without electronics will only get worse, the animated film Wall-E demonstrates what can happen if people refuse to give themselves a break from technology.
