<h1>Remix Project</h1>
<p>Finally, the Remix project is one of the last assignments you will work on in the class and is far different from the previous assignments. For the Remix project you are asked to create a documentary instead of writing a paper. This project allows you to get creative and work in groups, which is a lot of fun. The video you need to make has to be based off of an earlier assignment that you or someone else in your group has completed previously in the class. Typically the cultural analysis paper is a common choice for this project. That gives you a lot of topics to work with and hopefully it allows you to create a documentary on a subject that interests you. Working in a group is very beneficial for this project because I think for the most part a lot of students havenâ€™t had to work on creating a video like this one and having other students in your group there to learn with together makes things easier. The project is a lot of fun to work on, but can be very difficult at times. Coming up with a way to design your project in order to make it appeal to an audience is really tough and if you are not familiar with iMovie or Windows Movie Maker the editing portion of the project can be difficult as well. Along with creating a documentary you are asked to write a memo for the project. The memo only has to be one to two pages and is very straightforward. You are asked basically to write down how you think the process of creating your documentary with your group went. The memo is an important component of the Remix project because it allows you to honestly let the Professor know how well you think your group worked together as a team and if you thought you could have done anything else to make a good documentary. The biggest thing for this project is to make sure you do not wait to work on the project until last minute. There are many elements that can be time consuming and it is just better to plan ahead with your group to avoid a stressful project. </p>
