			<h1>Small Moments, Big Decisions</h1>
			<p>In any given day it is almost impossible to go without being sold a product or idea. This does not mean there is a salesman on every corner of your walk to work or school, insisting you to try the latest and greatest technology. However, think about all of the advertisements you see throughout your day. In theory they are doing the exact thing a salesman does, they urge you to buy their product. Most of us don’t even notice the countless number of ads we see; we have become so used to them that it seems we are almost desensitized to their presence. On occasion though, we cannot help but stop and take notice of the very catchy and appealing advertisement with its bright colors and witty slogan. It’s that type of advertisement that I hope to create in the future with my major in marketing.</p>
			<p>When applying for Michigan State my senior year of high school, I was tempted to put undecided down for my major. It felt like such a big decision. How could I decide what I wanted to study in college when I didn’t even know what I wanted to do when I was older? When I was little I wanted to be a princess or a mom, and those aren’t exactly offered majors at MSU. So I slept on it for a while, and eventually the choice seemed so obvious. Noticing the overlooked instances in my life, I realized they all pointed to the perfect major for me…marketing. These instances all involved me watching television ads at different times in my life. Without television I’m not sure I would have ever realized my love of marketing. Not only did television help me decide my major, it also helped me decide on two specific focuses of the marketing process that I would like to go into as a career.
 </p>
			<p>You may remember being a child dazed, with eyes glossed over, being unable to peel your eyes away from the television because of the shiny new toy that was being advertised on TV. I know I definitely do, because when I was younger I lived for those advertisements. After Arthur on PBS Kids there would be tons of commercials for new products for kids. I’m sure it was a grueling experience for my mother to have to deal with my whining and begging after seeing a commercial for a new Barbie doll or Easy Bake Oven, but I couldn’t help it. I was mesmerized. Fast-forward 15 years and I’m still falling for advertisements on TV, specifically mascara ads. It’s not that I’m some crazy mascara fanatic, the commercials on television are just so convincing! The women’s eyelashes in the commercials are flawless and you can’t help but want to own the same mascara that the actress is wearing. I’m smarter now than I was when I was younger though, because now I resist the urge to go out and buy every brand of mascara that is advertised on TV. I make due with my run of the mill Maybelline mascara, but still, it’s hard not to fall into the trap that is unrealistic mascara commercials.</p>
			<p>This hypnotized, must-have frenzy that I go into after seeing a commercial for mascara is exactly the type of reaction marketers want viewers to have. The people who are behind these advertisements are far from stupid. They know exactly what age groups and genders are watching each television program, so they can effectively advertise a product that fits the demographic watching a particular show. All of this information that is collected is from people that work as market researchers. This is a focus in marketing that I would potentially like to go into for a career. Market researchers take data that they have collected from their consumers, both quantitative and qualitative, and then analyze that data in order to make decisions about the product that they are selling. There are hundreds of different ways that market researchers get their information. From technology that tracks what you buy on your credit card, to cookies on the internet that track what websites you visit, market researchers gather information through tons of different mediums. After collecting the data they need marketers go to work, finding ways to advertise the specific products that will appeal the most to you. So it’s really the market researchers who knew me so well, putting up commercials for the Jam N’ Glam Barbie I was dying to have. However, due to a few more experiences dealing with television ads, another branch of marketing has also caught my eye. </p>
			<p>I think there is nothing more satisfying then seeing a really great commercial on TV. Think about the Super bowl, and how many people watch it not just for the obvious football game, but also for the popular commercials during breaks. The good ones you look up on YouTube to show your friends in the days afterward, and the bad ones you either make fun of or try to forget you ever saw them. All throughout my life I have found myself critiquing commercials. If I see a good advertisement it really sticks in my head and makes an impact on me. If I see a bad ad I think about other possibilities that the company could have done in order to make their product and its presentation look more appealing. Later when taking a Marketing class in high school I really noticed my desire to come up with advertisements. We had an assignment that had us create a product that doesn’t exist yet, and then create a fake TV ad for that product. I loved this activity and it was then when I started to take notice of myself correcting bad ads or really loving good ones. I found that I took a lot more interest in commercials then my friends did and I never noticed that I frequently asked people if they had seen a particular commercial. Even if they had though, it didn’t occur to them to be a big deal. This is how I knew that a career in marketing, specifically developing ads, would really suit me. Although I especially enjoy TV ads, I wouldn’t limit myself to only creating TV commercials. TV advertisements are just what opened my eyes to this particular occupation, but I like the idea of creating many types of advertisements through different types of mediums. In the end I just really enjoy coming up with ideas that promote a product in a positive way that encourage people to buy it.</p>
			<p>The television has been the most important piece of technology in helping me declare my major. Watching TV as a kid, drooling over whatever sparkly, girly toy was being advertised really lead to my interest in market research and how it works. Later in my life I found myself constantly evaluating commercials without taking much notice. When I did notice though, I realized I had a future in creating advertisements just like the ones I was watching. The small moments in my life involving something as simple as a television commercial have helped me decide what to study in college and have also helped me choose two distinct focuses of marketing to go into for a career.</p>
