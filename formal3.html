			<h1>Background Information</h1>
			<p>There are many important components involved in running a business; however, marketing is one of the only disciplines in business that is centralized around the customer.  Marketers aim to produce products that consumers want to buy. The consumer-orientation view of marketing as a whole can be split up into what is referred to as the marketing mix. The marketing mix consists of the “four p’s”, which stands for product, price, place and promotion. These four elements work together to create a marketing plan that caters directly to the target market. Under the product part of the marketing mix, research is done and decisions about the product are made. Effects like design, quality, and features of the product are researched and then decided upon. After studies are done, the look and specific details such as the brand name of the product are determined and put into place. All of these aspects need to be looked into so that once the product goes on the market; the consumer knows what the item looks like and what exactly the item offers. The second element of the four p’s is price. The price of the product is an important piece of the marketing mix that includes information like what the list price should be, as well as discounts, and the payment period offered on the item. Price is important because the economy is constantly changing, and the price of the product needs to hold up no matter what the economic status. The good or service also needs to be able to compete with other companies that create the same type of product. Another component of the marketing mix is place. This part looks at where the buyers will find the product being sold and what kind of stores the item is being sold at. Place is very important in marketing, because if a product is advertised or sold where no one will see it, then the item will not sell. Sarah Ewert, a Liberty Title employee and member of the company’s Marketing Team referred to “place”, as product positioning. She stated, “Product positioning is a very important aspect of marketing, it is based on understanding the demographics from the consumers and finding the best place to sell your product based on the information you have gathered”. When deciding on a location for a product marketers look to wherever their target market is most concentrated, this will ensure that the people that are most likely to purchase the good will see it. The last of the four p’s is promotion. Promotion is basically the advertising side of marketing. Companies need to decide what kind of medium they are going to use to promote their product, as well as look into details such as what time they will advertise the merchandise. The time of the advertisement does not necessarily mean if the ad will play at night or during the day, time can also refer to the time of the year. It is very typical for companies to advertise certain items during the summer and not the winter, because some items are seasonal. All together the four p’s create a marketing plan that will help any company successfully market a product to consumers. The four p’s are just a synopsis of the marketing process though, there are a few more elements required in the discipline, one of the very important pieces is advertising.</p>
