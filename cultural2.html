			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Imagine having to go a whole day without your phone…stressful just thinking about it isn’t it? Not having a phone on hand makes most people feel anxious, almost naked and incomplete without it. In this day and age humans rely on technology for a lot in their lives, some might even say they rely too much. People expect most things to be done for them by a push of a button and if it’s not that easy we tend to get angry. This dependency is only getting worse as time goes on and more technology is being created. The Disney movie Wall-E shows how this extreme reliance on technology will only escalate in the future if we do not put limits on how much we use our electronics. Some companies have already made programs that encourage kicking the technology addiction. These programs urge people to get out and take part in other tech. free activities.  Relying too much on technology can potentially harm the well being of humans, the movie Wall-E illustrates the possible downfall of this reliance and in order to prevent negative events like those in Wall-E from occurring more programs promoting going electronic free should be implemented.</p>
