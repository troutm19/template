<h1>Lived Experiences</h1>
<p>The first assignment we were given in the class is the Lived Experiences Project. This assignment requires you to pick a piece of technology that affected your choice in deciding your major at the university. You are asked to write about how the piece of technology specifically influenced your chosen major. The assignment was supposed to be a narrative that walked the reader through how the chosen piece of technology affected your choice in a major and also how that technology relates to the discipline that you hope to go into. This paper improved my writing skills a lot, because in high school I grew accustomed to writing papers that were very formal. I didn’t have a lot of experience in constructing a paper with a very laid back and personal format.  It was definitely challenging at first to force myself to create a paper that didn’t sound super formal, but later I really got into the assignment and enjoyed getting to write more of a story instead of a dry formal essay. The Lived Experiences Project was the first narrative I had ever had to write for a writing/English class and really helped me improve my writing skills. This is just the first of many assignments in the class that will help expand your skills in writing.
